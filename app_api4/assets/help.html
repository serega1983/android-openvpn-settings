<u><b>Missing Features</b></u><br/>
- Display more details about ongoing connection in notification area.<br/> 
<p/>

<u><b>Logging</b></u><br/>
Use <i>adb logcat</i> on your host.
<i>OpenVPN Settings</i> currently relies heavily on <i>adb logcat</i>
to give you all information about what's going on.
This comes in handy especially when setting up a new tunnel.
<p/>

<u><b>Setup</b></u><br/>
1. Connect your phone via USB to your computer and mount the sdcard.<br/>
2. Create a directory named <i>openvpn</i> at the root of your sdcard.<br/>
3. Copy your certificates and <i>*.conf</i> files into that directory (The config files need to end in <i>.conf</i> or <i>.ovpn</i> ).<br/>
4. Unmount the sdcard.
5. You might need to hit refresh from the menu if you started <i>OpenVPN Settings</i> already.<br/>
6. Start <i>adb logcat</i> on your computer to monitor activity.<br/>
7. Open activity <i>OpenVPN Settings</i> and enable your tunnel.<br/>

In general it would be best to get your config running from a shell, e.g. using <i>adb shell</i>.
<p/>

<u><b>DNS Support</b></u><br/>
DNS Support is somewhat tricky to get right. Nevertheless it should work.
If you experience hanging connections for no obvious reason,
please try 'Fix DNS' from the main options menu. This will make a public DNS server the default.
The next time network connectivity changes defaults provided by your ISP will be set.
This is a new feature, please report any problems but also success.
