# History of OpenVPN for Android Devices #

I ported openvpn to Android in March 2009 as a personal project. In September 2009 I made my openvpn git repositories for android available on github:

  * http://github.com/fries/android-external-openvpn
  * http://github.com/fries/android-external-openssl
  * http://github.com/fries/android-external-liblzo

Along I wrote an little App which evolved into OpenVPN Settings. After publishing OpenVPN Settings to the market in February 2010 I didn't pay much attention to it as I thought the public interest would be modest at best. A very busy year passed. As of January 2012 about 36000 people are using OpenVPN on Android regularly.
