## Support the Development ##

Imagine a man earning his living as a professional software engineer.
He is lucky as he turned his hobby into his profession!
After a full day working for his client he is coming home to his wife and two children. Just to immediately sit down and work on an open source app called _OpenVPN Settings_ which he is giving away for _free_.

It should be obvious such a life style is not sustainable for very long.

Please consider a donation, so I can free some time from my clients
and devote it to _you_, improving _OpenVPN Settings_ guided by your needs!
